## 📝 Learn-nodejs

### 💡 Plan or target! 
- Learn the common API of Node.js
- To make clear the architecture of Node.js

### 🤔 Why do this?
- I am just a front-end engineer. I can not create a project which needs server client support. when I want to make some application, I need a back-end engineer to give me the interface, it's so inconvenient for private projects. 🤨
- I think as a sophisticated software engineer, proficient in not only front-end language but also backend is a basic ability, I want to have a try. 😄
